Use gethostinfo() to convert IP addresses to presentation format.
Doesn't help that we don't appear to store the remote hosts address anyway.
Mostly done, except for getRemotePort()

Reformat all the code according to the standard WF style.

Check in files other that skstream.cpp that they use :: in front of
library and system calls.

It may well be pointless to attempt IPv6 support without using
getaddrinfo. Probably cleaner just to remove the IPv6 stuff from the
non- getaddrinfo case.

tcp_socket_stream is passing a reference up to the next class to be
constructed before the stream buffer object referred to has been constructed.
This results in a "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value"
error from valgrind.

- convert the linux detection code in skstream.h to use configure tests

Use a -DHAVESKSTREAMCONFIG_H to tell the code to include the genereated header, else
include a pre-defined one.
