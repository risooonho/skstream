Fix setTarget to compile on systems that don't have getaddrinfo.

Modify server code to use getaddrinfo. Generally handle the multiple addresses
that getaddrinfo returns, especially in client software. Made easier
by the fact that we can give a port number to getaddrinfo as a string.

It may be apropriate to write a test to see if
getaddrinfo(0, "", &req, &ans);
reliably gives us a general purpose listen socket, given AI_PASSIVE.

tcp_socket_stream is passing a reference up to the next class to be
constructed before the stream buffer object referred to has been constructed.
This results in a "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value"
error from valgrind.

Remove deprecated calls from API (is_ready)

Remove virtual function definitions from the headers, and put in .cpp file.

- convert the linux detection code in skstream.h to use configure tests

Use a -DHAVESKSTREAMCONFIG_H to tell the code to include the genereated header, else
include a pre-defined one.
