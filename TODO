tcp_socket_stream is passing a reference up to the next class to be
constructed before the stream buffer object referred to has been constructed.
This results in a "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value"
error from valgrind.

Remove deprecated calls from API (is_ready)

Remove virtual function definitions from the headers, and put in .cpp file.

- convert the linux detection code in skstream.h to use configure tests

Use a -DHAVESKSTREAMCONFIG_H to tell the code to include the genereated header, else
include a pre-defined one.
