Need to sort for once and for all the issue of streambuf objects
being part of the superclass.

Fix up ping.cpp to use provided features to do low level stuff, adding
features to the library if necessary.

Reformat all the code according to the standard WF style.

tcp_socket_stream is passing a reference up to the next class to be
constructed before the stream buffer object referred to has been constructed.
This results in a "Conditional jump or move depends on uninitialised value"
error from valgrind.

Use a -DHAVESKSTREAMCONFIG_H to tell the code to include the genereated header, else
include a pre-defined one.
